assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}
myMean(assignment2)

Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found

An error happened because the function refers to variables (assignment, someData) that arenâ€™t defined.

> myMean <- function(assignment2) {
+   return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
+ }
> 
> myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.25

This is the corrected version with the variables defined correctly
